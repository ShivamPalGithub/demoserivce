 "public class Person"
Person class is Generic class. A Generic class simply means that the items or functions in that class can be generalized with the parameter(example T) to specify that we can add any type as a parameter in place of T like Integer, Character, String, Double,Class or any other user-defined type.
There are 2 methods in class:
1. public String convertObjectToJsonString()
Generic Method: Generic Java method takes a parameter and returns some value after performing a task. It is exactly like a normal function, however, a generic method has type parameters that are cited by actual type. This allows the generic method to be used in a more general way. This method convert the object to json string and return to string.
